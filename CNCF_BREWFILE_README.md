# CNCF Brewfile

This Brewfile contains [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulas for all CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) projects that publish packages in [homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core).

## Overview

The Brewfile is organized by CNCF project maturity levels:

- **Graduated Projects**: Production-ready projects with proven enterprise adoption (31 formulas)
- **Incubating Projects**: Stable projects with growing adoption (25 formulas)
- **Sandbox Projects**: Early-stage projects exploring cloud-native innovations (33 formulas)

**Total**: 89 Homebrew formulas for CNCF projects

## Usage

### Install All CNCF Projects

To install all CNCF projects available on Homebrew:

```bash
brew bundle --file=cncf.Brewfile
```

### Install Specific Sections

To install only projects from a specific maturity level, create a custom Brewfile:

```bash
# Install only Graduated projects
sed -n '/=== GRADUATED PROJECTS ===/,/=== INCUBATING PROJECTS ===/p' cncf.Brewfile | grep '^brew' > graduated.Brewfile
brew bundle --file=graduated.Brewfile

# Install only Incubating projects
sed -n '/=== INCUBATING PROJECTS ===/,/=== SANDBOX PROJECTS ===/p' cncf.Brewfile | grep '^brew' > incubating.Brewfile
brew bundle --file=incubating.Brewfile

# Install only Sandbox projects
sed -n '/=== SANDBOX PROJECTS ===/,/=== SUMMARY ===/p' cncf.Brewfile | grep '^brew' > sandbox.Brewfile
brew bundle --file=sandbox.Brewfile
```

### Install Individual Projects

You can also install individual projects directly:

```bash
# Install Kubernetes CLI
brew install kubernetes-cli

# Install Prometheus
brew install prometheus

# Install Helm
brew install helm
```

## Notable Projects

### Graduated Projects (Production-Ready)

- **Kubernetes** (`kubernetes-cli`) - Container orchestration platform
- **Prometheus** (`prometheus`) - Monitoring and alerting toolkit
- **Helm** (`helm`) - Kubernetes package manager
- **Istio** (`istioctl`) - Service mesh platform
- **Argo** (`argo`, `argocd`) - GitOps and workflow engine
- **Flux** (`flux`) - GitOps toolkit for Kubernetes
- **etcd** (`etcd`) - Distributed key-value store
- **containerd** (`containerd`) - Container runtime
- **Envoy** (`envoy`) - Cloud-native proxy
- **Linkerd** (`linkerd`) - Service mesh
- **Cilium** (`cilium-cli`) - eBPF-based networking and security

### Incubating Projects (Growing Adoption)

- **Lima** (`lima`) - Linux virtual machines on macOS
- **Keycloak** (`keycloak`) - Identity and access management
- **Kubescape** (`kubescape`) - Kubernetes security scanner
- **OpenCost** (`opencost`) - Kubernetes cost monitoring
- **Thanos** (`thanos`) - Prometheus long-term storage
- **Contour** (`contour`) - Kubernetes ingress controller
- **NATS** (`nats-server`) - Messaging system

### Sandbox Projects (Innovation)

- **k3s** (`k3s`) - Lightweight Kubernetes
- **k0s** (`k0s`) - Zero-friction Kubernetes
- **Telepresence** (`telepresence`) - Local Kubernetes development
- **Carvel** (`ytt`, `kapp`, `kbld`, `imgpkg`, `vendir`) - Kubernetes tooling
- **WasmEdge** (`wasmedge`) - WebAssembly runtime
- **Porter** (`porter`) - Cloud installer framework

## Validation

The Brewfile includes a test script to validate its structure:

```bash
./test-brewfile.sh
```

This script checks:
- ✓ File exists and is readable
- ✓ Ruby syntax is valid
- ✓ All three maturity level sections are present
- ✓ No duplicate formulas
- ✓ All formulas have valid format

## Data Source

This Brewfile is generated from the official [CNCF Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/) data, specifically from the [landscape.yml](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/blob/master/landscape.yml) file in the [@cncf/landscape](https://github.com/cncf/landscape) repository.

## Updates

To regenerate this Brewfile with the latest CNCF projects:

1. The Brewfile is generated by parsing the CNCF landscape data
2. Projects are matched against known Homebrew formulas in homebrew-core
3. Projects are organized by their official CNCF maturity level

## Notes

- Not all CNCF projects publish Homebrew packages
- Some projects have multiple formulas (e.g., Argo has both `argo` and `argocd`)
- Some projects only have CLI tools in Homebrew, not the full server components
- Formula names may differ from project names (e.g., Kubernetes → `kubernetes-cli`)

## Contributing

If you notice a CNCF project is missing from this Brewfile and has a Homebrew formula, please open an issue or pull request.

## License

This Brewfile is part of the jorgepilot project. The formulas themselves are maintained by the Homebrew community and individual projects.
