# Jorgepilot

This is an experiment to see how useful Copilot can be to a Community Engineer. I use it my own personal interface to asking GitHub things, built for my specific needs. It's served by docusaurus to GitHub pages so I can share my ideas with friends. 

This will likely be more verbose than the [actual Jorge](https://ypsidanger.com). This may be a mistake.

## Why?

### Why not a general purpose LLM?
All of the answers I need are in GitHub projects already. I also set this up so it just uses GitHub's API.

### What's this one for?

This handles my hobby project, [Project Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io) as well as my work things at [the CNCF](https://cncf.io). Use this repo as a template, follow the customization guide and make your own with your favorite combination of github orgs and repos. 

### Why not just use chat?
I prefer to use GitHub issues for everything. That way I can edit over time, get input from others, etc, then just ask the agentic mode to generate a report on the issue. 

Also I don't use copilot all the time, by keeping my source of truth OUTSIDE of copilot I can always export easily, and crucially, use other LLMs and sources for information if need be. I'm not locked into copilot. But also by being on github I can connect other LLMs as I see fit. 

Also I can just add a bunch of static pages, I intend to see if I can make this a knowledge base. 

### How would you do this locally?

Since it's just a git repo if I'm every working on something with a local LLM (which I almost always am) I can also "feed" this website from a local machine. I just add a page to docusaurus locally. And it all stays in sync.

### Isn't this just a wiki for lazy people?

Yep!
