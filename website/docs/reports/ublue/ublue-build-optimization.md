# ublue-os Build Pipeline Optimization Opportunities

## Executive Summary

Analysis of GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines across [@ublue-os](https://github.com/ublue-os) reveals a sophisticated build infrastructure with opportunities for optimization. Current builds average 30-45 minutes with modern caching and parallelization already in place. Six high-impact optimization opportunities identified could reduce build times by 30-50%: smarter matrix scheduling, parallel COPR enablement, base layer caching, dependency pre-fetching, matrix consolidation, and workflow deduplication. Total potential time savings: 15-25 minutes per build, 2-4 hours daily across the ecosystem.

## Overview

## Current State

### Existing Optimizations

:::info Strong Foundation
Modern caching and space management already implemented across repositories
:::

**Implemented Best Practices:**

1. **GitHub Actions Cache**
   - RPM package caching
   - Kernel module caching
   - Reduces redundant downloads
   - Effectiveness: ~5 minutes saved per build

2. **container-storage-action**
   - Manages GitHub Actions runner disk space
   - Prevents out-of-space failures on large builds
   - Critical for Bazzite's extensive matrix
   - Cleanup: ~10GB freed per runner

3. **Rechunking (composefs)**
   - Post-build layer optimization
   - Reduces final image sizes
   - Improves pull performance for users
   - Savings: 20-30% reduction in image size

4. **Reusable Workflows**
   - DRY principle applied
   - Consistent build process across repos
   - Easier maintenance and updates
   - Reduces workflow duplication

5. **Parallel Matrix Execution**
   - GitHub Actions native parallelization
   - Multiple variants build simultaneously
   - Constrained by runner availability
   - Efficiency: Near-optimal for available runners

### Build Architecture

**Typical Build Flow:**

```
1. Checkout code (30s)
2. Setup environment (1-2min)
3. Enable COPR repos (3-5min) ‚ö†Ô∏è BOTTLENECK
4. DNF metadata refresh (2-3min) ‚ö†Ô∏è BOTTLENECK
5. Install packages (10-15min)
6. Build container image (5-10min)
7. Rechunk layers (3-5min)
8. Push to registry (2-4min)
9. Sign image (1min)
```

**Total:** 30-45 minutes per variant

### Resource Utilization

| Resource                   | Utilization            | Constraint                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **GitHub Actions Minutes** | 8,000-12,000/month     | Generous free tier               |
| **Runner Disk Space**      | 20-40GB per build      | container-storage-action manages |
| **Network Bandwidth**      | 5-10GB downloads/build | COPR mirrors, base images        |
| **Parallelization**        | 20-30 concurrent jobs  | GitHub runner availability       |

## Build Bottlenecks

:::caution Identified Bottlenecks
Five primary bottlenecks account for 40-60% of build time
:::

### Bottleneck Analysis

| Bottleneck                       | Time Impact | Frequency          | Priority  |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| **COPR Repository Enablement**   | 3-5 min     | Every build        | üî¥ High   |
| **DNF Metadata Refresh**         | 2-3 min     | Every build        | üî¥ High   |
| **Full Matrix on Small Changes** | 20-30 min   | 60% of builds      | üü° Medium |
| **RPM Package Downloads**        | 5-8 min     | Partial cache hits | üü° Medium |
| **Base Image Rebuilds**          | 10-15 min   | Dependency changes | üü¢ Low    |

**1. COPR Repository Enablement (Serial Operations)**

Current implementation enables COPR repositories individually:

```bash
dnf config-manager --set-enabled copr1
dnf config-manager --set-enabled copr2
dnf config-manager --set-enabled copr3
dnf makecache
```

**Issue:** Each enable operation contacts remote servers serially  
**Impact:** 3-5 minutes depending on network latency and COPR count

**2. DNF Metadata Refresh**

Metadata downloaded fresh on each build even when packages unchanged.

**Issue:** No metadata caching between builds  
**Impact:** 2-3 minutes per build

**3. Full Matrix Builds on Small Changes**

PR changing single-file docs triggers full 25-variant build matrix in Bazzite.

**Issue:** No path-based filtering for changed variants  
**Impact:** 20-30 unnecessary minutes on minor changes

**4. RPM Package Downloads**

While GitHub Actions cache helps, cache misses or evictions require full downloads.

**Issue:** Large RPM packages re-downloaded periodically  
**Impact:** 5-8 minutes on cache misses

**5. Workflow File Duplication**

Similar workflow logic duplicated across repositories.

**Issue:** Maintenance overhead and inconsistencies  
**Impact:** Indirect (maintenance time)

## Optimization Opportunities

:::tip High-Impact Optimizations
Six optimization opportunities with measurable time savings
:::

### 1. Smarter Matrix Scheduling

**Problem:** Full matrix builds on every PR regardless of changed files

**Solution:** Implement path-based matrix filtering

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    variant: ${{ fromJSON(needs.detect-changes.outputs.variants) }}
```

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Add job to detect changed files
2. Map files to affected variants
3. Filter matrix to only changed variants
4. Keep full matrix for main branch merges

**Expected Savings:** 20-30 minutes on 60% of PR builds  
**Effort:** Low (2-4 hours implementation)  
**Risk:** Low (fallback to full matrix)

**Priority:** üî¥ **High**

### 2. Parallel COPR Repository Enablement

**Problem:** Serial COPR repository enablement wastes time

**Solution:** Consolidate repository files and single metadata refresh

```bash
# Copy all .repo files at once
cp /tmp/*.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
# Single metadata refresh
dnf makecache --refresh
```

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Pre-generate all .repo files
2. Copy in single operation
3. Run single dnf makecache

**Expected Savings:** 2-4 minutes per build  
**Effort:** Low (1-2 hours)  
**Risk:** Very Low

**Priority:** üî¥ **High**

### 3. Base Layer Caching Strategy

**Problem:** Base layers rebuilt unnecessarily

**Solution:** Create cached base images with common dependencies

```dockerfile
# base-cached:fedora-42
FROM fedora:42
RUN dnf install -y common-packages
# Downstream images use cached base
FROM base-cached:fedora-42
```

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Identify common package sets
2. Create base-cached images
3. Publish to GHCR
4. Update downstream Containerfiles
5. Trigger base rebuilds on dependency changes only

**Expected Savings:** 10-15 minutes on incremental builds  
**Effort:** Medium (8-16 hours)  
**Risk:** Medium (cache invalidation complexity)

**Priority:** üü° **Medium**

### 4. Dependency Pre-fetching

**Problem:** RPM packages downloaded repeatedly

**Solution:** Enhanced caching with pre-fetch layer

```yaml
- name: Pre-fetch common packages
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: /var/cache/dnf
    key: dnf-cache-${{ hashFiles('packages.list') }}
```

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Generate package lists
2. Download to cache before main build
3. Share cache across matrix jobs
4. Update cache weekly

**Expected Savings:** 3-5 minutes per job  
**Effort:** Low (2-4 hours)  
**Risk:** Low

**Priority:** üü° **Medium**

### 5. Matrix Configuration Optimization

**Problem:** Bazzite builds 25-35 variants, some combinations rare

**Solution:** Tiered build strategy

- **Tier 1 (Always):** Popular variants (Deck, Desktop GNOME/KDE)
- **Tier 2 (Daily):** Handheld devices (ROG Ally, Legion Go)
- **Tier 3 (Weekly):** Niche variants

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Analyze download statistics
2. Categorize variants by popularity
3. Implement tiered scheduling
4. Provide on-demand builds for Tier 2/3

**Expected Savings:** 15-20 minutes on routine builds  
**Effort:** Medium (8-12 hours)  
**Risk:** Medium (user expectations)

**Priority:** üü¢ **Low-Medium**

### 6. Workflow Consolidation

**Problem:** Similar workflows duplicated across repos

**Solution:** Enhanced reusable workflows

- Single source of truth
- Pass variant-specific parameters
- Centralized updates

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Extract common workflow logic
2. Create parameterized reusable workflows
3. Migrate repos to reusable workflows
4. Maintain single workflow repo

**Expected Savings:** Indirect (maintenance time)  
**Effort:** Medium-High (16-24 hours)  
**Risk:** Low

**Priority:** üü¢ **Low** (quality of life)
