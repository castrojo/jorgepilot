:::info NVIDIA Availability
NVIDIA driver versions are only listed in NVIDIA-specific image variants. Non-NVIDIA images do not include kmod-nvidia packages. The most recent stable release **stable-20251012** includes NVIDIA driver **[580.95.05-1](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/254665/)**.
:::

## How to Switch to a Specific Version

To switch to any of these versions, use the `bootc switch` command with signature enforcement based on [@bootc-dev/bootc](https://github.com/containers/bootc):

### Stable Channel

```bash
# Get your current image name
IMAGE_NAME=$(jq -r '."image-name"' < /usr/share/ublue-os/image-info.json)

# Switch to latest stable (currently stable-20251012)
sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/ublue-os/$IMAGE_NAME:stable

# Switch to a specific stable version
sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/ublue-os/$IMAGE_NAME:stable-20251012

# Switch to an older stable version (e.g., stable-20250928)
sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/ublue-os/$IMAGE_NAME:stable-20250928

# Reboot to apply changes
sudo systemctl reboot
```

### GTS (Long Term Support) Channel

```bash
# Get your current image name
IMAGE_NAME=$(jq -r '."image-name"' < /usr/share/ublue-os/image-info.json)

# Switch to latest GTS
sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/ublue-os/$IMAGE_NAME:gts

# Switch to a specific GTS version
sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/ublue-os/$IMAGE_NAME:gts-20251012

# Reboot to apply changes
sudo systemctl reboot
```

:::tip Finding Your Current Version
Check your current Bluefin version with:
```bash
rpm-ostree status
```
:::

:::info Signature Enforcement
The `--enforce-container-sigpolicy` flag ensures you're always running a signed image, maintaining security and integrity of your system.

## Testing & Rollback Strategy

### For Users Testing Driver Issues

1. **Identify the suspected problematic version** from the table above
2. **Switch to the previous stable version** using `bootc switch`
3. **Test your specific use case** (desktop performance, hardware compatibility, etc.)
4. **Report findings** in the [@ublue-os/bluefin](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin) issue tracker with specific version numbers
