## Contributor Risk

:::caution Moderate Concentration
Strong Block employee dominance with emerging community participation
:::

### Maintainer Concentration

| Risk Factor | Assessment | Details |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Individual Concentration** | Moderate | Top 3 contributors: ~40% of recent commits |
| **Single Point of Failure** | Moderate | Bus factor: ~5-7 (healthy for project size) |
| **Organization Diversity** | Low | All core maintainers from Block |
| **Geographic Distribution** | Good | Contributors across global timezones |

### Bus Factor Analysis

**Bus Factor: 6-7** (Moderate Risk)

The project has a healthy core team of 7 core maintainers from Block, with active participation across multiple timezones. While there's heavy Block employee involvement, the growing community contributor base (70+ unique contributors in Q3 2025) provides redundancy. Recent Hacktoberfest activity shows increasing community engagement that could further improve this metric.

**Mitigation Factors:**
- Multiple maintainers capable of handling core responsibilities
- Growing external contributor base (90+ new contributors in 12 months)
- Well-documented contribution processes
- Active mentorship visible in PR reviews
