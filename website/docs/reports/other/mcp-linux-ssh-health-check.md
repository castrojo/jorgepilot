### Recommendations

#### High Priority

1. **Add Testing Infrastructure**
   - **Rationale**: Rust's type system helps, but integration tests would catch tool execution issues
   - **Action**: Add unit tests for command construction, integration tests for tool behavior
   - **Timeline**: Next release cycle

2. **Enable Dependabot**
   - **Rationale**: Automated security updates for Rust dependencies
   - **Action**: Enable Dependabot in GitHub repo settings
   - **Timeline**: Immediate

#### Medium Priority

3. **Add SECURITY.md**
   - **Rationale**: Clear vulnerability reporting process builds trust
   - **Action**: Document how to report security issues privately
   - **Timeline**: Before v0.2.0

4. **Add CONTRIBUTING.md**
   - **Rationale**: Encourage community participation
   - **Action**: Document contribution process, code style, testing requirements
   - **Timeline**: Before v0.2.0

5. **Expand Platform Testing**
   - **Rationale**: Ensure binaries work across all advertised platforms
   - **Action**: Test on BSD systems, various Linux distributions
   - **Timeline**: Ongoing

#### Low Priority

6. **Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**
   - **Rationale**: Important as community grows
   - **Action**: Adopt standard CoC (Contributor Covenant)
   - **Timeline**: Before first external contributor

7. **Create Project Roadmap**
   - **Rationale**: Communicate future direction
   - **Action**: Document planned features and improvements
   - **Timeline**: After v0.2.0

8. **Community Outreach**
   - **Rationale**: Gather feedback and users
   - **Action**: Share in MCP community, Rust forums, sysadmin communities
   - **Timeline**: Ongoing
