# Booty Project Health Report

## Executive Summary

[@jeefy/booty](https://github.com/jeefy/booty) is a personal utility project demonstrating minimal but stable maintenance. The project serves as a lightweight iPXE/PXE server for booting Flatcar Linux, CoreOS, and Universal Blue images. Activity over the past 12 months (October 2024 - October 2025) shows 5 commits focused on bug fixes and minor improvements, characteristic of a mature tool in maintenance mode rather than active development.

## Overview

Booty is a simple (i)PXE server designed for network booting of immutable Linux distributions. Built in Go with a Vue.js web interface, it automates PXE boot configuration, Butane-to-Ignition conversion, and system updates.

## Contributor Risk

:::danger Critical Concentration
Single-maintainer project with no redundancy
:::

### Maintainer Concentration

| Risk Factor | Assessment | Details |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Individual Concentration** | Critical | 100% commits by @jeefy |
| **Single Point of Failure** | Critical | Bus factor of 1 |
| **Organization Diversity** | Single | Personal project, no organizational backing |
| **Geographic Distribution** | Single | One individual contributor |

### Bus Factor Analysis

**Bus Factor: 1** (Critical Risk)

Booty is entirely dependent on @jeefy's continued availability. No succession plan, co-maintainers, or organizational support exists. For a personal utility project, this is acceptable, but adopters should understand the maintenance risk.

### Security Considerations

**Deployment Context:** Booty runs as a privileged network service (DHCP/TFTP/HTTP) with direct host network access. Security considerations:
- No authentication on web UI
- No authorization controls
- Designed for trusted networks only
- Container signing via Cosign and SLSA attestation (GitHub Actions)

**Supply Chain:**
- Docker images built via GitHub Actions
- Images signed with Cosign
- SLSA provenance attestation
- Published to GitHub Container Registry

## Adoption & Ecosystem

:::info Limited Adoption Data

## Comparison to Similar Projects

### Positioning

Booty occupies a niche space:
- **Simpler than**: Pixiecore, Metal³, Tinkerbell
- **Less feature-rich than**: netboot.xyz
- **Focused on**: Immutable/atomic Linux distributions
- **Designed for**: Homelab and small-scale deployments

## Risks & Recommendations

:::warning Areas for Attention
Critical single-maintainer risk and aging release
:::

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Severity | Impact | Likelihood |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| **Single Maintainer** | 🔴 Critical | Project abandonment risk | Medium |
| **No Security Policy** | 🟡 Medium | Unclear vulnerability disclosure | Low |
| **Stale Release** | 🟡 Medium | Users rely on unversioned `main` | High |
| **No Dependency Updates** | 🟡 Medium | Potential security vulnerabilities | Medium |
| **Zero Community Growth** | 🟢 Low | Acceptable for personal project | Low |

### Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation | Rationale | Timeline |
|----------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| **Medium** | Cut v0.4 release | 5 commits since v0.3 deserve versioning | 1 week |
| **Medium** | Add SECURITY.md | Document vulnerability reporting | 1 hour |
| **Low** | Enable Dependabot | Automate Go dependency updates | 1 hour |
| **Low** | Add CONTRIBUTING.md | Lower barrier for contributions | 1 hour |
| **Low** | Consider co-maintainer | Reduce bus factor | Ongoing |

## Areas of Excellence

Despite minimal activity, the project demonstrates:
- **Clear Purpose**: Well-defined scope and use case
- **Clean Code**: Go backend with Vue.js frontend, organized structure
- **Practical Examples**: Docker and Kubernetes deployment examples
- **Supply Chain Security**: Container signing and SLSA attestation
- **Zero Backlog**: No open issues demonstrates scope control

## Project Maturity Assessment

**Maturity Level**: Personal Utility (Maintenance Mode)

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Functional and stable
- ✅ Solves specific use case well
- ⚠️ Minimal ongoing development
- ❌ No community growth strategy
- ❌ No formal governance

**Suitable For:**
- Personal homelab PXE boot automation
- Small-scale Kubernetes bare-metal provisioning
- Learning iPXE/PXE boot concepts
- Users comfortable with minimal support

**Not Suitable For:**
- Production environments requiring SLAs
- Organizations needing vendor support
- Large-scale deployments (50+ nodes)
- Projects requiring active feature development

## Conclusion

Booty demonstrates a healthy personal utility project in maintenance mode. @jeefy has created a focused, functional tool that solves a specific problem well. The lack of recent releases (21 months) and minimal commit activity (5 commits in 12 months) indicate the project has reached feature completeness for the author's needs.

For potential adopters, the primary consideration is the **single-maintainer risk**. The project functions well but offers no guarantees of continued maintenance. Users should evaluate whether they can fork and maintain it themselves if needed.

The project's clearest strengths are its **narrow focus** and **clean implementation**. Rather than trying to be a comprehensive PXE solution, Booty specializes in booting immutable Linux distributions—a pragmatic scope decision for a personal project.

**Health Grade: B- (Good for Purpose, Maintenance Mode)**

This grade reflects a functional, well-implemented personal project operating in maintenance mode. The "B-" acknowledges the single-maintainer risk while recognizing the project achieves its goals within its defined scope.

**Data Source**: [@jeefy/booty](https://github.com/jeefy/booty) repository (GitHub API)

**Note on Data:** This analysis focuses on publicly observable GitHub activity over the past 12 months. Private usage, deployment scale, and non-GitHub contributions (if any) are not captured. The project's personal utility nature means low activity may indicate satisfaction with current functionality rather than abandonment.
