## Executive Summary

*(To be completed in Session 4)*

DevOpsDays Web is the community platform powering the global DevOpsDays conference series. Initial analysis shows an exceptionally active project with daily commits, strong governance practices, and a mature deployment pipeline.

## Overview

[@devopsdays/devopsdays-web](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-web) is the Hugo-based static site generator that powers [devopsdays.org](https://www.devopsdays.org), enabling DevOps conference organizers worldwide to create and manage their event websites. This health check evaluates project activity from **October 17, 2024 to October 17, 2025** (past 365 days).

**Repository:** [@devopsdays/devopsdays-web](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-web)  
**Primary Language:** HTML (Hugo templates), CSS, JavaScript  
**Created:** 2015 (ongoing since then)  
**Open Issues:** 54  
**License:** Apache License 2.0

**Analysis Period:** October 17, 2024 - October 17, 2025 (Past 365 days)

### Project Purpose

DevOpsDays Web serves as a centralized platform for:
- **Event Management:** Organizers manage event content (speakers, sponsors, schedules) via YAML data files
- **Static Site Generation:** Hugo builds individual event sites from shared templates
- **Community Coordination:** Core team maintains theme and infrastructure while event teams manage content
- **Historical Archive:** Preserves past events dating back to 2015

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Static Site Generator** | Hugo (Go-based) | Builds HTML from templates and data |
| **Deployment** | Netlify | Automated CI/CD with PR previews |
| **Version Control** | Git/GitHub | Collaboration and code review |
| **Build Tools** | Gulp, npm | Asset processing and automation |
| **Styling** | Bootstrap, SASS | Frontend framework and styling |
| **Icons** | Font Awesome | UI iconography |

## Governance Structure

:::info Strong Governance
DevOpsDays Web demonstrates mature governance with clear ownership boundaries, CODEOWNERS enforcement, and team-based access control.
:::

### Code Ownership Model

The project uses GitHub's CODEOWNERS file to enforce review requirements for different parts of the codebase:

| Path | Required Reviewers | Purpose |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| `/themes/devopsdays-theme/` | @devopsdays/theme-maintainers | Theme code changes |
| `/config/`, `/utilities/` | @devopsdays/code-reviewers | Core functionality |
| `/data/events/`, `/content/events/` | @devopsdays/content-reviewers | Event content |
| Build infrastructure (`.github/`, `netlify.toml`) | @devopsdays/build-infra | CI/CD configuration |

This separation ensures:
- **Content contributors** (event organizers) can update their events without touching core code
- **Theme developers** must have changes reviewed by maintainers
- **Infrastructure changes** require build-infra team approval

### Contributing Guidelines

The project maintains comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md documentation covering:
- ✅ **Local development setup** (Hugo installation, Docker options)
- ✅ **Pull request process** (fork, branch, PR naming conventions)
- ✅ **Event-specific changes** (YAML data file management)
- ✅ **Code review requirements** (maintainer guidelines)
- ✅ **Testing expectations** (GitHub Actions validation, Netlify previews)

**Notable Governance Practices:**
- PRs are merged immediately when checks pass (no lingering WIP PRs)
- Conflicts of interest addressed (2+ reviewers for conflicted changes)
- Event organizers must be on contact list to edit their event
- Non-content changes require special review from code-reviewers team

### Team Structure

Based on CODEOWNERS file, the project has at least 4 specialized teams:
1. **theme-maintainers** - Hugo theme development and maintenance
2. **code-reviewers** - Core functionality and configuration
3. **content-reviewers** - Event content validation
4. **build-infra** - CI/CD, deployment, and infrastructure

## License & Compliance

:::tip Excellent Compliance
Apache 2.0 license with proper third-party attribution for all dependencies.
:::

**Primary License:** Apache License 2.0 (2016-2021 devopsdays)

**Third-Party Licenses Documented:**
- Bootstrap: MIT License (`/LICENSES/BOOTSTRAP-MIT-LICENSE`)
- jssocials: MIT License (`/LICENSES/JSSOCIALS-MIT-LICENSE`)
- jQuery: MIT License (`/LICENSES/JQUERY-MIT-LICENSE`)
- Font Awesome: MIT, SIL OFL, CC BY licenses (documented in project)

**Assessment:** The project demonstrates excellent license hygiene by:
- Using a permissive open source license (Apache 2.0)
- Documenting all third-party dependencies and their licenses
- Maintaining a `/LICENSES/` directory for attribution
- Properly crediting incorporated libraries in LICENSE file

## Build & Deployment

:::tip Excellent Automated Pipeline
Continuous deployment with automated testing, multi-platform builds, and instant preview environments.
:::

### CI/CD Pipeline

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
- **Lint checks** - Validates all filenames are lowercase (cross-platform compatibility)
- **Linux build** - Hugo build on ubuntu-latest
- **Windows build** - Hugo build on windows-latest  
- **HTML validation** - Gulp html-min checks for invalid HTML

**Netlify Integration:**
- **Automated deployment** - Main branch commits trigger production builds
- **PR previews** - Every pull request gets ephemeral preview URL for review
- **Build time** - Hugo generates static site in seconds

### No Formal Releases

**Deployment Model:** Continuous deployment (no version tags or releases)

The project uses a **continuous deployment model** where:
- Every merge to `main` automatically deploys to production (devopsdays.org)
- No semantic versioning or tagged releases
- Event content updates go live immediately after merge
- Theme updates deploy continuously rather than in versioned releases

**Rationale:** This model suits a content-heavy website where:
- Event organizers need rapid updates (CFP deadlines, speaker announcements)
- Site stability is maintained through automated tests before deploy
- Rollback is possible via Git revert if issues arise

## Release Activity

:::info Continuous Deployment Model
No formal releases - project uses continuous deployment with automated builds on every merge to main.
:::

### Deployment Pattern

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Release Cadence** | Continuous | Multiple deploys per day |
| **Version Strategy** | None (CD model) | Appropriate for content platform |
| **Deployment Frequency** | Daily | Very high deployment velocity |
| **Rollback Capability** | Git revert | Standard practice for static sites |

**Recent Activity (October 2025):**
- October 17: Multiple merges for event updates (Zurich 2026, Istanbul 2025, Buenos Aires 2026)
- October 16: Event updates (Atlanta 2026, Denver organizers)
- October 15: Core team updates, new event additions
- October 14-15: Registration links, sponsor updates, Copenhagen 2026 setup

The high frequency of merges (multiple per day) demonstrates:
- **Active community engagement** - Organizers worldwide updating their events
- **Responsive maintainers** - PRs merged quickly after checks pass
- **Mature automation** - CI/CD pipeline handles high merge volume reliably

### Issue Health Assessment

**Backlog Status:** ⚠️ **Moderate - Some Aging Issues**

The 54 open issues represent:
- **Active Enhancement Pipeline:** Many issues are feature requests with active discussion
- **Some Technical Debt:** A few long-standing issues (2+ years) need attention
- **Reasonable Bug Count:** Only ~8-12 bugs, most low-severity
- **Good Triage:** Issues have appropriate labels (enhancement, bug, documentation, etc.)

**Notable Patterns:**
- Issues remain open for extended periods but have thoughtful discussion
- Some enhancements proposed but not prioritized due to backwards compatibility concerns
- External dependencies occasionally cause issues (pronoun.is example)
- Theme refactoring work (theme 2.0) has been ongoing since 2020
