## Executive Summary

*To be completed in Session 4*

## Overview

**Repository:** [@k3s-io/k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s)  
**Created:** 2018 (approximately)  
**Category:** Non-CNCF Project (Independent Kubernetes Distribution)  
**Primary Maintainer:** Rancher Labs (SUSE)  
**License:** Apache 2.0  
**Language:** Go  

**Analysis Period:** October 13, 2024 - October 13, 2025 (Past 365 days)

K3s is a lightweight, fully conformant Kubernetes distribution packaged as a single binary less than 100 MB. It is production-ready, designed for edge, IoT, CI, development, and ARM environments where resource constraints are a concern. K3s is explicitly NOT a fork of Kubernetes—it's a distribution that packages Kubernetes with additional components and maintains minimal patches (under 1000 lines) to support its use case.

## Release Activity

:::tip Excellent Release Cadence
Regular releases across multiple Kubernetes versions with consistent monthly patch releases
:::

### Recent Releases (Past 30 Days - September 2025)

| Version | Release Date | Days Since Previous | Type | Kubernetes Version | Highlights |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|------|--------------------|-----------|
| v1.34.1+k3s1 | 2025-09-22 | - | Major | v1.34.1 | First release in 1.34 line, containerd v2.1.4, runc v1.3.1 |
| v1.33.5+k3s1 | 2025-09-22 | Same day | Patch | v1.33.5 | Backports for 2025-09, containerd v2.1.4, k3s-root v0.15.0 |
| v1.32.9+k3s1 | 2025-09-22 | Same day | Patch | v1.32.9 | Security/stability fixes, containerd v2.1.4 |
| v1.31.13+k3s1 | 2025-09-22 | Same day | Patch | v1.31.13 | Maintenance release, runc v1.2.7 |

### Release Metrics

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Release Cadence** | Multiple per month | Excellent - supports 4+ parallel Kubernetes versions |
| **Release Consistency** | Highly regular | Coordinated releases across versions on same day |
| **Version Strategy** | k8s version + k3s postfix | Clear, follows upstream Kubernetes closely |
| **Supported K8s Versions** | 1.31, 1.32, 1.33, 1.34 | Excellent - maintains multiple active releases |
| **Patch Release Target** | Within 1 week of upstream | Met consistently |

**Notable Release Patterns:**
- K3s releases multiple versions simultaneously (e.g., 4 releases on 2025-09-22)
- Each release tracks upstream Kubernetes version precisely
- Postfix versioning (`+k3s1`, `+k3s2`) allows multiple releases for same K8s version
- Regular RC (release candidate) builds before stable releases
- Comprehensive release notes with embedded component versions

- Governance documentation: Direct repository file review
- Contributor analysis: GitHub REST API (100 recent commits analyzed)
- Activity patterns: Commit history analysis (July-October 2025)
- Security assessment: Pending (Session 3)

**Session Progress:**
- **Session 1 (Complete):** Foundation & metadata - gathered basic repository info, analyzed recent releases, reviewed governance files
- **Session 2 (Complete):** Activity analysis - analyzed 100 recent commits (Jul-Oct 2025), identified top 15 contributors, assessed PR/issue responsiveness
- **Session 3 (Pending):** Community & security - diversity, security practices, inclusivity
