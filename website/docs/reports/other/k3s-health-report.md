## Executive Summary

*To be completed in Session 4*

## Overview

**Repository:** [@k3s-io/k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s)  
**Created:** 2018 (approximately)  
**Category:** Non-CNCF Project (Independent Kubernetes Distribution)  
**Primary Maintainer:** Rancher Labs (SUSE)  
**License:** Apache 2.0  
**Language:** Go  

**Analysis Period:** October 13, 2024 - October 13, 2025 (Past 365 days)

K3s is a lightweight, fully conformant Kubernetes distribution packaged as a single binary less than 100 MB. It is production-ready, designed for edge, IoT, CI, development, and ARM environments where resource constraints are a concern. K3s is explicitly NOT a fork of Kubernetes—it's a distribution that packages Kubernetes with additional components and maintains minimal patches (under 1000 lines) to support its use case.

## Release Activity

:::tip Excellent Release Cadence
Regular releases across multiple Kubernetes versions with consistent monthly patch releases
:::

### Recent Releases (Past 30 Days - September 2025)

| Version | Release Date | Days Since Previous | Type | Kubernetes Version | Highlights |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|------|--------------------|-----------|
| v1.34.1+k3s1 | 2025-09-22 | - | Major | v1.34.1 | First release in 1.34 line, containerd v2.1.4, runc v1.3.1 |
| v1.33.5+k3s1 | 2025-09-22 | Same day | Patch | v1.33.5 | Backports for 2025-09, containerd v2.1.4, k3s-root v0.15.0 |
| v1.32.9+k3s1 | 2025-09-22 | Same day | Patch | v1.32.9 | Security/stability fixes, containerd v2.1.4 |
| v1.31.13+k3s1 | 2025-09-22 | Same day | Patch | v1.31.13 | Maintenance release, runc v1.2.7 |

### Release Metrics

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Release Cadence** | Multiple per month | Excellent - supports 4+ parallel Kubernetes versions |
| **Release Consistency** | Highly regular | Coordinated releases across versions on same day |
| **Version Strategy** | k8s version + k3s postfix | Clear, follows upstream Kubernetes closely |
| **Supported K8s Versions** | 1.31, 1.32, 1.33, 1.34 | Excellent - maintains multiple active releases |
| **Patch Release Target** | Within 1 week of upstream | Met consistently |
| **Minor Release Target** | Within 30 days of upstream | Met based on recent releases |

**Notable Release Patterns:**
- K3s releases multiple versions simultaneously (e.g., 4 releases on 2025-09-22)
- Each release tracks upstream Kubernetes version precisely
- Postfix versioning (`+k3s1`, `+k3s2`) allows multiple releases for same K8s version
- Regular RC (release candidate) builds before stable releases
- Comprehensive release notes with embedded component versions

### Embedded Component Versions (v1.34.1+k3s1 - Latest)

| Component | Version | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Kubernetes | v1.34.1 | Core orchestration |
| Kine | v0.14.0 | Datastore shim |
| SQLite | 3.50.4 | Default storage backend |
| Etcd | v3.6.4-k3s3 | Optional distributed storage |
| Containerd | v2.1.4-k3s2 | Container runtime |
| Runc | v1.3.1 | Low-level runtime |
| Flannel | v0.27.0 | CNI networking |
| Metrics-server | v0.8.0 | Resource metrics |
| Traefik | v3.3.6 | Ingress controller |
| CoreDNS | v1.12.3 | DNS service |
| Helm-controller | v0.16.13 | Helm manifest deployment |
| Local-path-provisioner | v0.0.32 | Local storage provisioning |

## Governance & Maintainership

:::info Corporate-Backed Open Source
Primarily maintained by SUSE/Rancher Labs with community engagement model
:::

### Governance Structure

| Indicator | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Code of Conduct** | ✅ | Reference to CoC in CONTRIBUTING.md |
| **Contributing Guide** | ✅ | Comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md (detailed PR process, DCO) |
| **Security Policy** | ⚠️ | Security email mentioned in README, no SECURITY.md file found |
| **License** | ✅ | Apache 2.0 |
| **Governance Documentation** | ⚠️ | Limited - no formal GOVERNANCE.md |
| **Decision-Making Transparency** | ✅ | Public PRs, issues, community meetings |

### Maintainer Structure

**Primary Maintainer: Rancher Labs (SUSE)**

K3s operates under a corporate-backed open source model where SUSE (via Rancher Labs) provides primary maintenance and development resources.

**Community Engagement:**
- Slack channels: #k3s and #k3s-contributor (rancher-users.slack.com)
- CNCF Slack: #k3s channel (cloud-native.slack.com)
- Community meetings: Monthly (AMS/EMEA and EMEA/APAC timezone-friendly)
- Meeting notes: https://hackmd.io/@k3s/meet-notes/
- Video recordings: K3s YouTube Channel

### Organizational Diversity

**Primary Organization: SUSE/Rancher Labs**

As a SUSE-maintained project, K3s has limited organizational diversity in core maintainership. However, the project accepts community contributions following standard open source practices (DCO signoff, PR review process).

- Governance documentation: Direct repository file review
- Contributor analysis: Pending (Session 2)
- Security assessment: Pending (Session 3)

**Session Progress:**
- **Session 1 (Complete):** Foundation & metadata - gathered basic repository info, analyzed recent releases, reviewed governance files
- **Session 2 (Pending):** Activity analysis - commits, PRs, contributor identification
- **Session 3 (Pending):** Community & security - diversity, security practices, inclusivity
- **Session 4 (Pending):** Finalization - adoption, risks, recommendations, executive summary
