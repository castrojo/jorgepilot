# DNF5 Project Health Check

## Executive Summary

[@rpm-software-management/dnf5](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf5) demonstrates strong project health as the next-generation package manager actively replacing DNF4. Analysis of the past 365 days (October 2024 - October 2025) shows robust development activity with 10 major releases, active feature development, and a highly engaged Red Hat engineering team. DNF5 is production-ready in Fedora 41+ and represents the strategic future of RPM package management.

| **Migration Challenges** | 🟡 Medium | User confusion during DNF4→DNF5 transition | Medium |
| **Plugin Ecosystem** | 🟢 Low | Some DNF4 plugins need porting | Low |
| **Issue Backlog Growth** | 🟢 Low | 367 open issues growing slowly | Medium |

### Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation | Rationale | Timeline |
|----------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| **Medium** | Pursue OpenSSF Best Practices badge | Formalize security practices | 6-12 months |
| **Medium** | Expand community maintainer base | Reduce Red Hat dependency | Ongoing |
| **Low** | Improve security policy documentation | Formal SECURITY.md | 3-6 months |
| **Low** | Automated dependency management | Reduce security lag | 6-12 months |

## Areas of Excellence

1. **Modern Architecture** - Complete rewrite with improved performance and API design
2. **Plugin System** - Extensible plugin architecture (Python and C++)
3. **D-Bus Integration** - Full-featured daemon for GUI tools
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - Extensive test coverage with CI/CD
5. **Documentation Quality** - Excellent API docs, tutorials, and migration guides
6. **Active Development** - Rapid feature development with community input

## Project Maturity Assessment

**Maturity Level**: Production-Ready/Active Development (Exceeds expectations)

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Production-ready and deployed as default in Fedora 41+
- ✅ Modern, performant architecture
- ✅ Regular feature releases with active development
- ✅ Excellent documentation and migration guides
- ✅ Strong engineering backing from Red Hat

**Suitable For:**
- Production RPM-based systems (Fedora 41+)
- New development requiring latest package management features
- Systems prioritizing performance
- Strategic long-term investments in RPM ecosystem

**Not Suitable For:**
- Systems requiring DNF4-specific plugins not yet ported
- Conservative environments not ready for DNF5 transition
- RHEL 8/9 (still using DNF4)

## Conclusion

DNF5 exhibits excellent health characteristics as an actively developed, production-ready package manager. With monthly releases, strong Red Hat engineering backing, and successful deployment as the default package manager in Fedora 41+, the project demonstrates robust momentum and strategic importance. The comprehensive plugin system, improved performance, and modern API design position DNF5 as the clear future of RPM package management.

The primary considerations are organizational diversity (heavy Red Hat concentration) and the ongoing transition from DNF4. However, these are appropriate given Red Hat's stewardship role in the RPM ecosystem. The project actively welcomes community contributions and has successfully onboarded multiple external contributors.

DNF5's role as critical infrastructure for millions of Linux systems is well-supported by its active development, comprehensive testing, and clear commitment to production quality. Users planning new deployments should adopt DNF5, while existing DNF4 users should plan migration as appropriate for their distribution timeline.

**Health Grade: A (Excellent)**

_Active development project with strong engineering backing and production deployment._
