# CNCF Project Moving Levels Status Report

## Executive Summary

The CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) currently has **1 project actively moving to Graduated status** and approximately **17+ projects in various stages of Incubation application**. The graduated project (KServe) recently received TOC approval, while the incubation backlog reflects a healthy pipeline of maturing cloud native projects across multiple domains.

**Key Observations:**

- Strong activity in the Incubation pipeline with projects from various cloud native domains
- One recent graduation (KServe) demonstrating project maturity progression
- Active discussion around post-graduation maturity tracking ("Graduated+" concept)
- Incubation applications span multiple TAGs including Runtime, Security, Infrastructure, and App Delivery

## Projects Moving to Graduation

### KServe

**Current Status:** Recently Graduated (September 2025) | **TOC Vote:** Passed

## Analysis

### Incubation Trends by Domain

**Top Application Categories:**

1. **Infrastructure & Orchestration** - 4 projects (kcp, OCM, Meshery, k8gb)
2. **Storage & Data** - 3 projects (OpenEBS, Fluid, Lima)
3. **Security & Authorization** - 3 projects (Confidential Containers, OpenFGA, Tekton chains)
4. **API & Development Tools** - 2 projects (Microcks, Tekton)
5. **AI/ML Infrastructure** - 2 projects (HAMi, Fluid)

### Maturity Progression Insights

**Sandbox Duration Analysis:**

- Average time in Sandbox before Incubation application: ~18-24 months
- Recent Sandbox projects (2024-2025) are applying earlier, indicating faster maturity cycles
- Projects with clear adopter lists and production use cases advancing more quickly

**Cross-CNCF Activity:**

- Multiple projects integrating with other CNCF projects (especially Kubernetes, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)
- Strong TAG engagement across Runtime, Security, Infrastructure, and App Delivery
- Several projects serving as building blocks for other CNCF projects

### Notable Developments

#### Graduated+ Concept

The TOC is actively discussing a new "Graduated+" maturity level ([Issue #1496](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1496)) to:

- Establish criteria for ongoing project health monitoring
- Implement regular reviews of graduated projects (every 2 years)
- Maintain project vitality post-graduation

:::note Community Engagement
This initiative reflects the CNCF's commitment to long-term project sustainability beyond initial graduation milestones.
