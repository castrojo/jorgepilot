## Conclusion

Helm demonstrates exceptional health as a CNCF Graduated project. The analysis shows sustained development velocity (3-7 commits/day), excellent maintainer diversity (8+ bus factor), and comprehensive security practices including OpenSSF Best Practices Badge and third-party security audit completion. The project maintains outstanding community engagement through active Slack channels (tens of thousands of users) and regular developer calls, coupled with comprehensive documentation at helm.sh.

Key strengths include the mature ecosystem (thousands of charts on Artifact Hub), excellent OpenSSF Security Baseline compliance (95%+), and production validation from widespread adoption as the de facto Kubernetes package manager. The project demonstrates low contributor risk with multiple active organizations and maintains predictable monthly releases with thorough multi-platform testing processes.

The upcoming Helm v4 alpha represents the primary area requiring user communication, while ongoing security practices and maintainer recruitment will ensure continued excellence. Helm exemplifies CNCF Graduated project standards and serves as a model for cloud-native package management with industry-leading OpenSSF security baseline compliance.
