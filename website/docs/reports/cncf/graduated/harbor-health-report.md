## Contributor Risk

:::caution Moderate Concentration
Strong VMware Broadcom presence with 5 of top 10 contributors. Organizational diversity exists but primary development is vendor-focused.
:::

### Maintainer Concentration

| Risk Factor | Assessment | Details |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Individual Concentration** | Moderate | Top 5 contributors: ~60% of commits |
| **Single Point of Failure** | Moderate | Key maintainers critical but team has depth |
| **Organization Diversity** | Moderate | VMware Broadcom dominant, 3-4 other orgs active |
| **Geographic Distribution** | Good | Asia (China), North America, Europe represented |

### Bus Factor Analysis

**Bus Factor: 4-5** (Moderate Risk)

The project has a core team of 4-5 highly active maintainers primarily from VMware Broadcom. Loss of any single maintainer would be manageable, but loss of 2-3 simultaneously would impact delivery velocity. The maintainer team has deep Harbor knowledge spanning 6+ years. Community contributors provide valuable additions but core architecture decisions remain centralized with the maintainer team.
