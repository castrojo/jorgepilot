# TAG Contributor Strategy Health Check Guide

## Executive Summary

This guide documents the CNCF TAG Contributor Strategy project health criteria used for conducting health checks on CNCF projects. It serves as a reference for future health check reports, ensuring consistency and enabling updates as the TAG Contributor Strategy evolves their recommendations.

## Overview

The [CNCF TAG Contributor Strategy](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy) provides frameworks and best practices for evaluating the health and sustainability of cloud-native open source projects. This guide consolidates the key criteria used in health check assessments.

## Core Health Check Criteria

- Commit frequency trends
- Code churn rate
- Development consistency

**Healthy Indicators:**
- Steady commit rate (3-10+ per day for active projects)
- Consistent activity across months
- Balanced feature vs. maintenance commits
- Regular weekday activity

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is development activity sustained?
- Are there long periods of inactivity?
- Is the trend growing, stable, or declining?

**Data Sources:**
- GitHub commit history
- Commit frequency analysis
- Contributor activity patterns

---

### 6. Issue Resolution

**Definition:** How effectively the project manages and resolves reported issues.

**Key Metrics:**
- Issues opened vs. closed per period
- Net issue growth rate
- Issue age distribution
- Issue type breakdown (bug/feature/question)

**Healthy Indicators:**
- Net issue growth: 0 to +10% per quarter (manageable)
- Regular issue closure
- Few very old unresolved issues
- Clear issue categorization

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is the issue backlog manageable?
- Are issues being resolved or accumulating?
- Is there effective triage?

**Data Sources:**
- GitHub issue statistics
- Issue open/close timeline analysis
- Issue label and type analysis

---

### 7. Release Cadence

**Definition:** Consistency and predictability of software releases.

**Key Metrics:**
- Time between releases
- Release schedule adherence
- Semantic versioning compliance
- Release note quality

**Healthy Indicators:**
- Predictable release schedule (monthly, quarterly, etc.)
- Semantic versioning followed
- Comprehensive release notes
- Regular security/dependency updates

**Assessment Questions:**
- Are releases predictable?
- Is there a documented release process?
- Are releases coordinated and announced?

## Health Check Report Structure

Based on TAG Contributor Strategy criteria, a comprehensive health check should include:

1. **Executive Summary** - 2-3 sentence overview of project health
2. **Overview** - Brief project context and scope
3. **Responsiveness** - PR and issue response analysis
4. **Contributor Activity** - Growth, diversity, and onboarding
5. **Contributor Risk** - Bus factor and concentration analysis
6. **Project Velocity** - Commit activity and development pace
7. **Release Activity** - Release cadence and dependency management
8. **Inclusivity Indicators** - Governance and community support
9. **Risks & Recommendations** - Identified concerns and actionable advice
10. **CNCF Standards Comparison** - Alignment table with criteria
11. **CNCF Blog Posts** - Recent relevant communications
12. **Associated Issues** - Links to tracked concerns
13. **Methodology** - Data sources and analysis approach

---

## Status Indicators

Use consistent status indicators across health checks:

- ✅ **Excellent/Strong** - Exceeds expectations, exemplary
- ✅ **Good/Healthy** - Meets expectations, no concerns
- ⚠️ **Moderate/Caution** - Meets minimum requirements, monitor
- ❌ **Concern/Risk** - Below expectations, needs attention
